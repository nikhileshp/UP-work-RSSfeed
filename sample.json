This should consist of both the ad copy and metrics that were used. If you are willing to show your campaigns via screenshare, that is a massive bonus. <br />\n2) Along with the ads you must be able to create ad copy. Bare in mind that I am currently in talks with multiple companies so if you are the right person we will be bringing you regular clients to keep you busy! <br />\n3) Try and make sure your case studies are explained as best as possible. <br /><br />\nFinally, the no.1 reason why I am placing so much emphasis on case studies and previous results is because this presents us with fresh results to LEVERAGE to get NEW CLIENTS! <br />\nThis is THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. This will be mutually beneficial for the both of us as I will be on boarding a new clients and you get paid as soon as the client is signed and ready to get going. <br /><br />\nAgain, someone who creates ads for the authors/magazines or who is experienced on as many social media platforms as possible such as: Facebook, Google, Instagram, Snapchat, Linkedin is ideal however if you can provide proof of outstanding previous results across any other niches, your application will be taken just as seriously. <br /><br />\nWe have massive ambition with our agency and are only after the best contractors at a reasonable price who will deliver.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $300\n<br /><b>Posted On</b>: March 30, 2020 12:10 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Social Media Marketing<br /><b>Skills</b>:Conversion Rate Optimization,     Facebook Marketing,     Instagram Marketing,     Internet Marketing,     Lead Generation,     Retargeting,     Social Media Marketing,     B2B,     Facebook Advertising,     Facebook Ad Campaign,     Instagram Ad Campaign,     Facebook Ads Manager,     Pixel Setup &amp; Optimization,     Social Media Advertising,     Video Ads    \n<br /><b>Skills</b>:        Conversion Rate Optimization,                     Facebook Marketing,                     Instagram Marketing,                     Internet Marketing,                     Lead Generation,                     Retargeting,                     Social Media Marketing,                     B2B,                     Facebook Advertising,                     Facebook Ad Campaign,                     Instagram Ad Campaign,                     Facebook Ads Manager,                     Pixel Setup &amp; Optimization,                     Social Media Advertising,                     Video Ads            <br /><b>Country</b>: United Kingdom\n<br /><a href="https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Facebook-ads-expert-WITH-PREVIOUS-CASE-STUDIES-and-proof-work-for-authors-with-books-magazines_%7E019915b5ee039067ea?source=rss">click to apply</a>",
